## Abstract
The "Inverted Walker" is a device which is designed to traverse a rope. We are required to use only a single degree of freedom linkage. This document outlines our approach to creating an efficient and stable walker. Our goal is to make sure that it has maximum speed so that it can traverse the rope in shortest time and it is also light weight.
Now, just as our name suggests, we are going to design the walker such that it resembles a monkey hanging on rope.

## Technical Description
### 1.	Design :

* The frame will be constructed using a simple design to ensure lightness and stability.
* The linkage mechanism will use a ‘crank-rocker’ system powered by the dual shaft motor.
* The center of gravity will be adjusted using weights attached to the structure to ensure stability on the rope.
* We will design and simulate the model, keeping proper physics in consideration, in a way that it walks in a most efficient way.

### 2.	Components and Resources:

* Motor: To drive the crank mechanism and move the robot along the rope.
* Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For connections between the motor, microcontroller, and power supply.
* Use Machines: For cutting and assembling the structure using 3D printer

### 3.	Working Mechanism:

* The motor will drive the crank mechanism, converting rotational motion into linear motion to propel the walker.
* An attachment system made using simple clamps will ensure the walker stays on the rope.

## Challenges and Solutions
### 1.	Maintaining balance and stability.

* Solution: Use perfect weight placement to lower the center of gravity and prevent falling down. Also make it light and Strong.
### 2.	Ensuring smooth movement along the rope.

* Solution: Using some soft material on the clamps to reduce friction between rope and clamps also make the shape Of hands to get the grip.

## Impact
This design demonstrates practical applications in:
* Cable Inspection: Robots designed for inspecting and maintaining power supply cables in hard-to-reach places.
* Emergency Response: Lightweight traversal devices for emergency supply delivery.
* Learning experience: Hands-on experience with robotics and mechanical linkages, gives problem solving and technical skills for us.

## Why Our Design Stands Out
1.	Limited Resources: We have utilised the limited components for a creative yet practical solution.
2.	Feasibility: The design is achievable with the given materials and time constraints because it is simple.
3.	Power Consumption: It consumes least possible power to complete the task
